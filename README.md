OOP and its key definitions

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP promotes the concept of objects, which have state (attributes) and behavior (methods). It aims to model real-world entities and their interactions in the code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows a class (subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and supports the concept of "is-a" relationship. The subclass inherits the fields and methods of the superclass and can add its own unique characteristics or override inherited methods. Inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword in Java.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It provides data hiding and protects the internal state of an object from direct access and modification by external code. Encapsulation allows the class to define how its data can be accessed and manipulated through public, private, and protected access modifiers. It helps in achieving better maintainability, flexibility, and security in code.

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface. It allows methods to be called on objects without knowing their specific types at compile time. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name but different parameters exist in a class. Polymorphism enables code flexibility, extensibility, and dynamic method dispatch.

Abstraction:
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in OOP that focuses on representing essential features and behavior of objects while hiding unnecessary details. It provides a high-level view or a simplified representation of real-world entities. Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes define common characteristics and can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Interfaces specify a contract of methods that implementing classes must adhere to. Abstraction promotes code modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns.

These concepts work together to create well-structured, modular, and flexible code in Java. They provide a powerful way to model complex systems, promote code reuse, and enable efficient development and maintenance of software applications.
